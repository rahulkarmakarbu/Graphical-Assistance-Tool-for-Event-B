# Graphical-Assistance-Tool-for-Event-B
The tool provides the graphical interface to design the Event-B components like Context, Machine, and events. It generates the refinement relationships between the components graphically. From the graphical tool, the Event-B context and machine files are generated.  
The tool then automatically generates the Python classes from the Event-B models.
